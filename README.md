In fact, this was a little part of semester assignment of my son.  
One day he asked me if I could composite MIDI files to one song, and I wondered where to put it.  
He told me about ['Mozart Dice Game'](http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Mozart/dice/). It was very interesting.

I have created a small program that plays MIDI files into one minuet. My son liked it very much and he could finish the semester presentation well.
