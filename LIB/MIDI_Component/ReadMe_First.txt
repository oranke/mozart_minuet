If you use default AnsiString based Delphi compiler (Delphi 2007 or earlier versions) you should have Tnt Delphi UNICODE Controls. (not required to be installed, but source units are to be proviided). 
Use MIDIComp_D7.dpk for Delphi 7 (or older version), MIDIComp.dproj for Delphi 2009 (or newer version) at installing components.
Or you can install each component (MidiPlayer2.pas, MIDIFile2.pas) seperately.

Use MIDIFileInfo_D7.dpr for Delphi 7 (or older version), MIDIFileInfo.dproj  for Delphi 2009 (or newer version) at compiling test application.
